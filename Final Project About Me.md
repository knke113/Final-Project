# About Me

<p/>My name is Konner Burnham and I am from St. Louis, Missouri. I was born in St. Louis but my fathers job kept us moving around quite a bit, between kindergarten and 9th grade I moved around 7 times. I moved from St. Louis to Jackson, Missouri. From Jackson I moved to Philadelphia, Moving 3 times inside of the state of Pennsylvania, before finally returning back to St. Louis in freshman year of high school. I have great parents and family, and am very blessed and thankful for them. I applied for Mizzou senior year of high school, excited to come here and begin a new chapter of my life. I came into school here as a 	Biology major, because of my love of the medical field. This year I decided to change my major as I have always had a love for computers and technology, but always saw it as more of a hobby, but I am now making it my career as I have a huge drive for it and a large amount of passion for the field.<p/> It has been an honor to be in your class this semester learning from you professor Musser. I have enjoyed every week and I feel I've actually learned more useful material in this one single class over any chemistry class. If anyone asked me to take this class, I would recommend it without a second thought in my mind. I hope you continue to teach with such drive and compassion for this topic and for your students, I know we appreciate you and all you do. Thank you.
